# RPCalculator
Scrapes screen data from a client and calculates the most efficient purchase of game currency and subsequent in-game puchase of cosmetics


Riot Games's League of Legends is a massively successful online game. It uses a free-to-play model, generating revenue instead through in-game purchases. 
The game client generates personalised in-game discounts based on the player's choice of character (Your Shop). 

This script is designed to scrape the relevant data from the client view and calculate the most efficient choice of purchase: both denominations of currency
and of subsquent Your Shop purchases. The objective of this programme is leave the least amount of risidual in-game currency made from said purchases.

How to use

Open League Client (on main display if using multiple monitors)

Set it's resolution to 720 (I'll scale for other resolutions at some point)

Navigate to shop

Launch RPCalculator.exe

Don't move the League Client Window

Currently, it just produces the numbers you already see on screen. I'll get round to actually doing womething with those numbers another time.
